# LandingPageFrameworks.com

[LandingPageFrameworks.com](LandingPageFrameworks.com), a leaderboard of the top frameworks for website developers. Lists include WordPress, Joomla, and SAAS Services, and boilerplates.

## Why?

Because we believe we should have a crowd sourced catalog of available options.

## Contributing

Missing a framework here? Just fork the repo and add your framework
as a `{name}.php` in the `src/frameworks` folder.

Make sure to follow the following rules:

*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other frameworks in `src/frameworks`.
*   **WordPress.org (optional):** If the framework is listed as a plugin on wp.org, please add a reference to the plugin's slug.
*   **Short description:** Keep the description for the overview page short and sweet. No need to mention it's a "framework" or adding "WordPress" in it. Please keep it informative, it's not a sales pitch :)
*   **Thumbprint:** If you want the framework to automatically list all plugins & themes from WordPress.org that are using it, you need to provide a unique combination of a file name and a string, which we'll use for identification. **The string should appear in the specified file.** If you are adding a starter theme, make sure that the thumbprint is not changed when implementing the theme.
